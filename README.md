# minesweeper-javascript
Having done this challenge project in pure CSS I came across the limit with randomization. For true replayability I will be using JavaScript this time to run the functions and will be styling it closer to the expected experience that one might find on a windows os.

I started off testing different things such as jquery to test out a few functions however I returned to something closer to my original code when I made it from CSS. This caused a merge issue and I reset again for another fresh start.
