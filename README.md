# minesweeper-javascript
Having done this challenge project in pure CSS I came across the limit with randomization. For true repeatability I will be using JavaScript this time to run the functions and will be styling it closer to the expected experience that one might find on a windows os.

I started off testing different things such as jquery to test out a few functions however I returned to something closer to my original code when I made it from CSS. This caused a merge issue and I reset again for another fresh start. I then changed the grid colour from the windows 95 style of greys to blues and white like my css version. The restart button was moved to the top with the mines left to change the style into the more modern version of minesweeper.
